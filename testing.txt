I wrote the program initally on my laptop, and then once I had something to test, I switched to the virtual machine. I used the files provided to do all of my testing. I primarily used the four smaller ones, because the larger were a bit overwhelming for my system. Once I had a working program to test, I used all six text files and started testing on os-class. I wrote the uniqifyTest script early on in the process, and used modified versions of it to automate all my testing throughout.
